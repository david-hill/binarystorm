[31m-# DESCRIPTION[m
[31m-#        The  optional  transport(5) table specifies a mapping from[m
[31m-#        email addresses to message delivery transports  and  next-[m
[31m-#        hop  destinations.   Message  delivery  transports such as[m
[31m-#        local or smtp are defined in the master.cf file, and next-[m
[31m-#        hop  destinations are typically hosts or domain names. The[m
[31m-#        table is searched by the trivial-rewrite(8) daemon.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        This  mapping  overrides  the  default   transport:nexthop[m
[31m-#        selection that is built into Postfix:[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        local_transport (default: local:$myhostname)[m
[31m-#               This  is  the default for final delivery to domains[m

[31m-#               tinations    that    match    $inet_interfaces   or[m
[31m-#               $proxy_interfaces. The default nexthop  destination[m
[31m-#               is the MTA hostname.[m

[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Normally, the transport(5) table is specified  as  a  text[m
[31m-#        file  that serves as input to the postmap(1) command.  The[m

[31m-#        "postmap /etc/postfix/transport"  to  rebuild  an  indexed[m
[31m-#        file after changing the corresponding transport table.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,[m
[31m-#        LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary[m

[31m-#        The lookup result is of the form  transport:nexthop.   The[m
[31m-#        transport  field  specifies a mail delivery transport such[m
[31m-#        as smtp or local. The nexthop field  specifies  where  and[m
[31m-#        how to deliver mail.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        The  transport field specifies the name of a mail delivery[m
[31m-#        transport (the first name of a mail delivery service entry[m
[31m-#        in the Postfix master.cf file).[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        The  interpretation  of  the  nexthop  field  is transport[m
[31m-#        dependent. In the case of SMTP, specify  a  service  on  a[m
[31m-#        non-default  port  as  host:service,  and disable MX (mail[m
[31m-#        exchanger) DNS lookups with [host] or [host]:port. The  [][m
[31m-#        form is required when you specify an IP address instead of[m
[31m-#        a hostname.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        A null transport and null nexthop  result  means  "do  not[m
[31m-#        change":  use  the delivery transport and nexthop informa-[m

[31m-# EXAMPLES[m
[31m-#        In  order to deliver internal mail directly, while using a[m

[31m-#        internal  destinations  (do not change the delivery trans-[m
[31m-#        port or the nexthop information) and  specify  a  wildcard[m
[31m-#        for all other destinations.[m

[31m-# [m
[31m-#        In  order  to send mail for example.com and its subdomains[m
[31m-#        via the uucp transport to the UUCP host named example:[m
[31m-# [m

[31m-#             .example.com     uucp:example[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        When no nexthop host name is  specified,  the  destination[m
[31m-#        domain  name  is  used instead. For example, the following[m
[31m-#        directs mail for user@example.com via the  slow  transport[m
[31m-#        to  a  mail exchanger for example.com.  The slow transport[m
[31m-#        could be configured to run at most one delivery process at[m
[31m-#        a time:[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#             example.com      slow:[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        When no transport is specified, Postfix uses the transport[m
[31m-#        that matches the address  domain  class  (see  DESCRIPTION[m
[31m-#        above).   The following sends all mail for example.com and[m
[31m-#        its subdomains to host gateway.example.com:[m

[31m-#             example.com      :[gateway.example.com][m
[31m-#             .example.com     :[gateway.example.com][m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        In the above example, the [] suppress  MX  lookups.   This[m
[31m-#        prevents  mail  routing loops when your machine is primary[m
[31m-#        MX host for example.com.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        In the case of delivery via SMTP, one  may  specify  host-[m
[31m-#        name:service instead of just a host:[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#             example.com      smtp:bar.example:2025[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        This directs mail for user@example.com to host bar.example[m
[31m-#        port 2025. Instead of a numerical port a symbolic name may[m
[31m-#        be used. Specify [] around the hostname if MX lookups must[m
[31m-#        be disabled.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        The error mailer can be used to bounce mail:[m

[31m-#             .example.com     error:mail for *.example.com is not deliverable[m
[31m-# [m

[31m-# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES[m
[31m-#        This  section  describes how the table lookups change when[m
[31m-#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For[m
[31m-#        a  description  of regular expression lookup table syntax,[m
[31m-#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Each pattern is a regular expression that  is  applied  to[m
[31m-#        the    entire    address    being    looked    up.   Thus,[m
[31m-#        some.domain.hierarchy is not  looked  up  via  its  parent[m
[31m-#        domains,  nor is user+foo@domain looked up as user@domain.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Patterns are applied in the order as specified in the  ta-[m
[31m-#        ble,  until  a  pattern  is  found that matches the search[m
[31m-#        string.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        The trivial-rewrite(8) server disallows regular expression[m
[31m-#        substitution  of  $1  etc.  in  regular  expression lookup[m

[31m-# TCP-BASED TABLES[m
[31m-#        This  section  describes how the table lookups change when[m

[31m-#        Postfix version 2.4.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Each  lookup  operation  uses the entire recipient address[m
[31m-#        once.  Thus, some.domain.hierarchy is not  looked  up  via[m
[31m-#        its  parent  domains,  nor is user+foo@domain looked up as[m

[31m-# DESCRIPTION[m
[31m-#        The  optional  virtual(5)  alias  table rewrites recipient[m
[31m-#        addresses for all local, all virtual, and all remote  mail[m
[31m-#        destinations.   This  is unlike the aliases(5) table which[m
[31m-#        is used only for local(8) delivery.  Virtual  aliasing  is[m
[31m-#        recursive,  and  is  implemented by the Postfix cleanup(8)[m
[31m-#        daemon before mail is queued.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        The main applications of virtual aliasing are:[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        o      To redirect mail for one address  to  one  or  more[m
[31m-#               addresses.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        o      To   implement  virtual  alias  domains  where  all[m
[31m-#               addresses  are  aliased  to  addresses   in   other[m
[31m-#               domains.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#               Virtual  alias  domains are not to be confused with[m
[31m-#               the virtual mailbox domains  that  are  implemented[m
[31m-#               with  the  Postfix  virtual(8) mail delivery agent.[m
[31m-#               With  virtual  mailbox  domains,   each   recipient[m
[31m-#               address can have its own mailbox.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Virtual  aliasing  is  applied  only to recipient envelope[m
[31m-#        addresses, and  does  not  affect  message  headers.   Use[m
[31m-#        canonical(5)   mapping  to  rewrite  header  and  envelope[m
[31m-#        addresses in general.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Normally, the virtual(5) alias table  is  specified  as  a[m
[31m-#        text  file that serves as input to the postmap(1) command.[m
[31m-#        The result, an indexed file in dbm or db format,  is  used[m
[31m-#        for fast searching by the mail system. Execute the command[m
[31m-#        "postmap /etc/postfix/virtual" to rebuild an indexed  file[m
[31m-#        after changing the corresponding text file.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        When  the  table  is provided via other means such as NIS,[m
[31m-#        LDAP or SQL, the same lookups are  done  as  for  ordinary[m
[31m-#        indexed files.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Alternatively,  the  table  can  be provided as a regular-[m
[31m-#        expression map where patterns are given as regular expres-[m
[31m-#        sions,  or lookups can be directed to TCP-based server. In[m
[31m-#        those case, the lookups are done in a  slightly  different[m
[31m-#        way  as  described below under "REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES"[m
[31m-#        or "TCP-BASED TABLES".[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-# CASE FOLDING[m
[31m-#        The search string is folded to lowercase  before  database[m
[31m-#        lookup.  As  of Postfix 2.3, the search string is not case[m
[31m-#        folded with database types such as regexp: or pcre:  whose[m
[31m-#        lookup fields can match both upper and lower case.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-# TABLE FORMAT[m
[31m-#        The input format for the postmap(1) command is as follows:[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        pattern result[m
[31m-#               When pattern matches a mail address, replace it  by[m
[31m-#               the corresponding result.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        blank lines and comments[m
[31m-#               Empty  lines and whitespace-only lines are ignored,[m
[31m-#               as are lines whose first  non-whitespace  character[m
[31m-#               is a `#'.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        multi-line text[m
[31m-#               A  logical  line starts with non-whitespace text. A[m
[31m-#               line that starts with whitespace continues a  logi-[m
[31m-#               cal line.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-# TABLE SEARCH ORDER[m
[31m-#        With lookups from indexed files such as DB or DBM, or from[m
[31m-#        networked tables such as NIS, LDAP or  SQL,  patterns  are[m
[31m-#        tried in the order as listed below:[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        user@domain address, address, ...[m
[31m-#               Redirect  mail  for  user@domain  to address.  This[m
[31m-#               form has the highest precedence.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        user address, address, ...[m
[31m-#               Redirect mail for user@site to address when site is[m
[31m-#               equal  to $myorigin, when site is listed in $mydes-[m
[31m-#               tination, or when it is listed in  $inet_interfaces[m
[31m-#               or $proxy_interfaces.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#               This  functionality  overlaps with functionality of[m
[31m-#               the local aliases(5) database.  The  difference  is[m
[31m-#               that virtual(5) mapping can be applied to non-local[m
[31m-#               addresses.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        @domain address, address, ...[m
[31m-#               Redirect mail for other users in domain to address.[m
[31m-#               This form has the lowest precedence.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#               Note:  @domain  is a wild-card. With this form, the[m
[31m-#               Postfix SMTP server accepts mail for any  recipient[m
[31m-#               in  domain,  regardless  of  whether that recipient[m
[31m-#               exists.  This may turn  your  mail  system  into  a[m
[31m-#               backscatter  source: Postfix first accepts mail for[m
[31m-#               non-existent recipients and then  tries  to  return[m
[31m-#               that  mail  as  "undeliverable" to the often forged[m
[31m-#               sender address.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-# RESULT ADDRESS REWRITING[m
[31m-#        The lookup result is subject to address rewriting:[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        o      When the result  has  the  form  @otherdomain,  the[m
[31m-#               result  becomes the same user in otherdomain.  This[m
[31m-#               works only for the first address in a multi-address[m
[31m-#               lookup result.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        o      When  "append_at_myorigin=yes", append "@$myorigin"[m
[31m-#               to addresses without "@domain".[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        o      When "append_dot_mydomain=yes", append ".$mydomain"[m
[31m-#               to addresses without ".domain".[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-# ADDRESS EXTENSION[m
[31m-#        When a mail address localpart contains the optional recip-[m
[31m-#        ient delimiter (e.g., user+foo@domain), the  lookup  order[m
[31m-#        becomes: user+foo@domain, user@domain, user+foo, user, and[m
[31m-#        @domain.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        The  propagate_unmatched_extensions   parameter   controls[m
[31m-#        whether  an  unmatched  address extension (+foo) is propa-[m
[31m-#        gated to the result of table lookup.[m

[31m-# VIRTUAL ALIAS DOMAINS[m
[31m-#        Besides virtual aliases, the virtual alias table can  also[m
[31m-#        be used to implement virtual alias domains. With a virtual[m
[31m-#        alias domain,  all  recipient  addresses  are  aliased  to[m
[31m-#        addresses in other domains.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Virtual alias domains are not to be confused with the vir-[m
[31m-#        tual mailbox domains that are implemented with the Postfix[m
[31m-#        virtual(8)  mail  delivery  agent.  With  virtual  mailbox[m
[31m-#        domains, each recipient address can have its own  mailbox.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        With  a  virtual  alias domain, the virtual domain has its[m
[31m-#        own user name space. Local  (i.e.  non-virtual)  usernames[m
[31m-#        are  not visible in a virtual alias domain. In particular,[m
[31m-#        local aliases(5) and local mailing lists are  not  visible[m

[31m-# REGULAR EXPRESSION TABLES[m
[31m-#        This section describes how the table lookups  change  when[m
[31m-#        the table is given in the form of regular expressions. For[m
[31m-#        a description of regular expression lookup  table  syntax,[m
[31m-#        see regexp_table(5) or pcre_table(5).[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Each  pattern  is  a regular expression that is applied to[m
[31m-#        the entire address being looked up. Thus, user@domain mail[m
[31m-#        addresses  are  not  broken up into their user and @domain[m
[31m-#        constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken up into user and[m
[31m-#        foo.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Patterns  are applied in the order as specified in the ta-[m
[31m-#        ble, until a pattern is  found  that  matches  the  search[m
[31m-#        string.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Results  are  the  same as with indexed file lookups, with[m
[31m-#        the additional feature that parenthesized substrings  from[m
[31m-#        the pattern can be interpolated as $1, $2 and so on.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-# TCP-BASED TABLES[m
[31m-#        This  section  describes how the table lookups change when[m
[31m-#        lookups are directed to a TCP-based server. For a descrip-[m
[31m-#        tion of the TCP client/server lookup protocol, see tcp_ta-[m
[31m-#        ble(5).  This feature is not available up to and including[m
[31m-#        Postfix version 2.4.[m
[31m-# [m
[31m-#        Each lookup operation uses the entire address once.  Thus,[m
[31m-#        user@domain mail addresses are not broken  up  into  their[m
[31m-#        user and @domain constituent parts, nor is user+foo broken[m
[31m-#        up into user and foo.[m
